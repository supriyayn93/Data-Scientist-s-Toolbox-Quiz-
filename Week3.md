Week 3 Solutions

 1.) We take a random sample of individuals in a population and identify whether they smoke and if they have cancer. We observe that 
there is a strong relationship between whether a person in the sample smoked or not and whether they have lung cancer. 
We claim that the smoking is related to lung cancer in the larger population. We explain we think that the reason for this 
relationship is because cigarette smoke contains known carcinogens such as arsenic and benzene, which make cells in the lungs 
become cancerous.

         a.) This is an example of a predictive data analysis.  

         b.) This is an example of an descriptive data analysis.

         c.) This is an example of a causal data analysis.

         d.) This is an example of an inferential data analysis.               -Right Answer
         
         
         
 2.) What is the most important thing in Data Science?

         a.) Machine learning and prediction.

         b.) Knowing Hadoop and Pig.

         c.) The question you are trying to answer.                  -Right Answer

         d.) Hacking skills.

 3.) If the goal of a study was to relate Martha Stewart Living Subscribers to Our Site's Users based on the number of people 
that lived in each region of the US, what would be the potential problem?

         a.) There would be confounding because the number of people that live in an area is related to both Martha Stewart Living 
         Subscribers and Our Site's Users.                   -Right Answer

         b.) We would be performing inference on the relationship between Martha Stewart Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.

         c.) We wouldn't be able to estimate the variability in Martha Stewart Living Subscribers.

         d.) We couldn't be sure whether subscribing to Martha Steward Living causes people to be Users of Our Site or 
           the other way around.
           
           
           
 4.) What is an experimental design tool that can be used to address variables that may be confounders at the design phase of an 
experiment?

         a.) Fixing variables.                               -Right Answer

         b.) Using data from a database.

         c.) Using all the data you have access too.

         d.) Taking a convenience sample.

         e.) Only using non-confounding variables.

         f.) Using regression models.

         g.) Data cleaning.
         
         h.) Stratifying variables.                          -Right Answer         




5.) What is the reason behind the explosion of interest in big data?

         a.) The price and difficulty of collecting and storing data has dramatically dropped.     -Right Answer

         b.) We have better experimental design now than previously.

         c.) We recently discovered ways to use data to make predictions.

         d.) We recently discovered ways to use data to answer scientific and business questions.
         
         e.) Technologies like Hadoop and Map Reduce started the big data era.

         f.) There have been massive improvements in statistical analysis techniques.yes

         g.) There have been massive improvements in machine learning algorithms.
